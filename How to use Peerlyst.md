How To Use Peerlyst

Peerlyst combines familiar social network capabilities with proprietary search technologies to connect you with peers and experts who can help you stay up to date and master the challenges of your job. Writing a post is the best way to share your insight and help others benefit from your experience. It’s your way to “pay it forward” to the tech community, the same community you‘ll be benefiting from when you need help. Find out about our policies in our FAQ.

How do I customize my wall so I see posts that are relevant to me?

When you sign up to Peerlyst, we provide you with a personalized feed of content from our community and news from 500+ security sources, based on your interests (the topics and people you follow). Find and follow what you want to see on your Peerlyst home page. Your wall (the "Home" tab in upper-left corner) is where you'll see posts from people, categories, and any vendors you decide to follow. Its default is to show you the newest posts that are highly ranked by the Peerlyst community.

What happens when I follow someone?

When you follow people, you get their posts on your feed, and they receive a notification that you're following them, along with the opportunity to follow you back. When you follow a category, for example “mobile security,” you see the new posts specifically related to that topic. When you follow a product or company, you get posts by and about them.

How do I discover people, tools, products, or companies?

Search! Our search is clean, focused on discovery, and free from the topic-interference you see on other social sites. It's also extremely customizable. You can filter products by functionality, characteristics, and fit for your organization. You can also find people by discovering mutual interests. Peerlyst allows you to find people by specific expertise and reputation in specific areas using the powerful tags. Also, you can locate people in a specific industry or location—even search by job title.

Peerlyst’s powerful proprietary search allows you to find people who can help you in your work, as well as research topics, companies, and products for your projects. You'll find thousands of tools, products, and companies on Peerlyst, plus the experience and knowledge of our huge, rapidly expanding peer community.

How do I write a post?

Click the "Home" tab in the upper left corner, and a blank post window will be at the top.

Prompts on the toolbar allow you to customize any text you've highlighted, add photos or videos, or include files with your post.
Text you've put in quotes will appear in colored text so you can see it, but will publish in black.
Change the size of photos by clicking the corner and dragging to enlarge or shrink.
Our system adds tags to your post for sitewide search purposes, and you can un-check any tags you don't want before you hit publish.
If you need to edit or delete a post you've published, click the drop-down arrow in the post's top-right corner and make your selection.
How do I create tags in a post?

Use mentions of @company, @product, @category, and @people; and add #tags like #BYOD or #forensics. That will ensure that your posts show up in searches, and that users following relevant topics get them in their feed.

What do the stars next to tags mean?

A user may have one or more stars next to a specific tag on their profile. This indicates that the user is a top expert on this topic across the entire Peerlyst site. Stars are based on the user's relative reputation compared to all the experts for that specific topic on Peerlyst.

What kind of content is good for a post?

Objective and opinionated content is welcome. Here are some suggestions:

Share your experience and knowledge. Feel like swapping work war stories, or speculating about what’s next for the industry? Whether you had a great or a not-so-great experience with a company, product, or service, write about it. That provides valuable insight to colleagues working with or researching similar products.
Educational content including information sharing, tools, guidelines, news, and reviews of a product or process are all great. Some of the most popular posts are how-to's and discussions that crowdsource industry solutions.
Reach out. If you want to learn more about a topic or master a problem, chances are your peers will, too. Enrich your community—and build your reputation—by asking questions and sharing what you know. Start a discussion, offer a counter-point, or ask opinions on an article or resource.
Tips for creating a great post:

Pick a great title. The best titles answer the question, “Why should someone read this?”
Cut to the chase. Your best shot of keeping your reader interested is to make your case succinctly. Aim for a word count of 500-1,000.
Add links, images, and tags. Illustrate your content with photos, charts, tables—anything visually appealing gets your point across. Check out iStock, Stock.xchng, Wikimedia Images, and Shutterstock for images.
Proofread before you hit publish. Check spelling and make sure you didn't forget any words, links, or tags.
Play nicely with others. Help keep community debate informed, spirited, passionate—but always respectful. Posts flagged as inflammatory or off-topic get removed.
How do I see all of my posts?

Click "Profile" on the top-left of the page.

What is "Invite a peer to this post"?

Along the bottom of each post you'll see clickable icons to upvote a post, share it on Peerlyst or social media, comment on it, flag it for our attention, and to "invite a peer." This is how you can let a specific person know they should read the post or its comments via email; either an email address you enter, or email sent through their Peerlyst profile.

How do I build my reputation?

Our reputation system is all about upvotes and shares, in addition to regular posting on a topic. When people give a post lots of love, that post, and the person behind it, get a higher ranking. The system is designed so that however you’re searching—by post, author, or tag—highly rated content will show up at the top of the results. By posting, Peerlysters build their reputation and showcase their expertise to the security community. If your contributions receive lots of up-votes and shares, it builds your reputation—and your profile will be ranked higher in searches involving your areas of expertise.

What content is likely going to be popular—and help me build my reputation?

Peerlyst isn’t a publisher (i.e., an authority dictating content and tone) so much as a facilitator. Our role is providing the platform that lets users generate the content they need. From what we’ve seen so far, the content our community values most shares practical, useful knowledge. Real-life scenarios beat out philosophical posts. From time to time, Peerlyst actively promotes content, and we typically promote posts that are useful to our users, such as tools, resources, guides, and how-tos.

A little controversy gets people talking, but going off the deep end turns people off (and anything offensive or totally off-topic will likely be flagged and pulled). Posts with inappropriate language, spam, marketing messages, sales promotions, and offensive content will be removed by Peerlyst.

How can I invite friends and colleagues to Peerlyst?

We believe there’s strength—and knowledge—in numbers, so we've made it as easy as pie to invite colleagues. Simply click the little person with a plus sign next to your profile icon in the top right-hand corner of the page, and fill in their email address. You can use the invite text we provide or customize it any way you like. We never give email addresses to any third parties, including vendors.
